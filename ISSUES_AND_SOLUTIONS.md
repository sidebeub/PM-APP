## Resolved Issues

### WebSocket Server Port Conflict
- **Issue**: WebSocket server port conflict - port 3001 is already in use
- **Solution**: 
  1. Implemented a port fallback mechanism in server/index.js that automatically tries the next available port if the default port is already in use
  2. Created a utility script (server/utils/killPortProcess.js) that can find and kill processes using specific ports
  3. Added a command-line tool (server/utils/killPort.js) for manual intervention
  4. Updated the server startup process to automatically kill processes using the required ports
  5. Added an npm script (npm run kill-port) for easy access to the port killing utility
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### WebSocket Rapid Updates
- **Issue**: WebSocket rapid updates causing infinite loops and performance issues
- **Solution**: 
  1. Implemented debouncing mechanism in websocketService.ts for both task and project updates
  2. Added TASK_UPDATE_DEBOUNCE and PROJECT_UPDATE_DEBOUNCE constants (2000ms)
  3. Created pendingTaskUpdates and pendingProjectUpdates maps to track pending updates
  4. Added logic to clear existing timeouts and update pending changes
  5. Implemented proper cleanup of timeouts and pending updates
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Project Update Loop After Task Creation
- **Issue**: After creating a task, the application enters an infinite loop of project updates
- **Solution**: 
  1. Fixed the WebSocket service's handleMessage function to properly handle project updates
  2. Ensured that timeouts are properly cleared before setting new ones
  3. Restructured the project update debouncing logic to match the task update logic
  4. Added proper error handling and logging for WebSocket messages
  5. Improved the message type handling to prevent unnecessary processing
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Project Form Infinite Loop
- **Issue**: Project form updates causing infinite loops due to unnecessary WebSocket updates
- **Solution**: 
  1. Added change detection in ProjectForm's handleSubmit function
  2. Compare current project data with form data before dispatching updates
  3. Only dispatch update action when actual changes are detected
  4. Prevent unnecessary WebSocket messages and re-renders
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved

### Task Creation Endpoint Returning 500 Error
- **Issue**: Task creation endpoint returning 500 error
- **Description**: Task creation was failing with a 500 Internal Server Error despite valid form data
- **Root Cause**: The task form was correctly setting default values for status and priority, but there was a potential issue with the database connection or transaction handling
- **Solution**: The issue resolved itself after verifying:
  1. Task form correctly sets default values (status: 'Pending', priority: 'Medium')
  2. Task controller properly validates required fields
  3. Task model correctly constructs SQL query
  4. Database schema has proper constraints
- **Resolution Date**: April 15, 2024
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Prevention**: Added additional logging in task creation endpoint to catch similar issues in the future

### Kanban Board Path Mismatch
- **Issue**: Kanban board link in sidebar was using '/simple-kanban' path while the route was configured as '/kanban'
- **Description**: Users were getting 404 errors when trying to access the Kanban board through the sidebar
- **Root Cause**: Path mismatch between the sidebar navigation configuration and the route definition in App.tsx
- **Solution**: Updated the path in the Sidebar component from '/simple-kanban' to '/kanban' to match the route in App.tsx
- **Resolution Date**: April 15, 2024
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Prevention**: Added a comment in the route configuration to document the correct path

### Gantt View Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: Gantt view was causing excessive API calls when tasks were updated
- **Description**: Each task update was triggering an immediate API call, leading to performance issues
- **Root Cause**: No debouncing or batching mechanism for task updates in the Gantt view
- **Solution**: 
  1. Implemented a debouncing mechanism with a 500ms delay
  2. Added batching to group multiple task updates together
  3. Added change detection to prevent unnecessary updates
  4. Implemented a notification system to show when updates are being saved
- **Resolution Date**: April 15, 2024
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Prevention**: Added comments in the code to document the debouncing and batching logic

### Task Form Change Detection
- **Issue**: Task form was causing unnecessary API calls when no changes were made
- **Description**: The form was dispatching update actions even when no fields were changed
- **Root Cause**: No change detection before dispatching update actions
- **Solution**: 
  1. Added change detection in the handleSubmit function
  2. Compare current task data with form data before dispatching updates
  3. Only dispatch update action when actual changes are detected
  4. Added proper error handling for failed updates
- **Resolution Date**: April 15, 2024
- **Status**: Resolved
- **Prevention**: Added comments in the code to document the change detection logic
